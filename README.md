Project Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of Interfaces in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Interfaces are a crucial aspect of OOP, enabling a class to adhere to a specific contract and interact with other classes and objects in a structured and predictable manner. By defining interfaces, we allow different parts of a system to interact seamlessly while promoting modular and reusable code.

Features
Core Concepts of Interfaces: This project covers the basics of what an interface is, its purpose, and how it is implemented in OOP.
Practical Examples: Demonstrates interface usage through examples that outline typical scenarios such as animal behaviors, vehicle functionalities, and device operations.
Code Structure and Design Patterns: Explores how interfaces can encourage design patterns like dependency injection, strategy patterns, and polymorphism.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A Java Development Kit (JDK) or relevant compiler if you're working in another OOP language.
Basic knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming.
Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mtaqi04/Interfaces.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Interfaces

3. Compile and run the project:

javac *.java
java Main


Project Structure
Main Interface Files: Defines the structure for the interface(s) used in the project, including method declarations.
Implementing Classes: Implements the interfaces, providing concrete definitions for the methods outlined in the interfaces.
Examples and Tests: Demonstrates how the interfaces and classes interact and includes sample outputs.
Key Concepts Covered
Abstraction and Contract: How interfaces define what a class can do without dictating how.
Polymorphism: Using interfaces to allow one interface to be implemented in different ways by different classes.
Loose Coupling: How interfaces help to achieve a loosely coupled codebase, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
Example Usage
Here's a basic example of interface usage in this project:
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

In this example:

The Animal interface provides a contract for makeSound() behavior.
The Dog class implements the Animal interface, providing its own version of makeSound().
